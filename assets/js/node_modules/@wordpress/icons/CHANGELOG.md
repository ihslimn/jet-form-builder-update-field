## Unreleased

## 4.1.0 (2021-07-21)

## 4.0.0 (2021-05-20)
### Breaking Changes

-   Removed icons: `camera`, `chartLine`, `closeCircleFilled`, `controlsRepeat`, `expand`, as they all have better existing alternatives, and were unused by the block editor. Instead of `camera`, use `capturePhoto`. Instead of `chartLine`, use `chartBar` or `trendingUp` or `trendingDown`, instead of `closeCircleFilled`, use `close`, instead of `controlsRepeat` which was used for Reusable Blocks, consider `reusableBlock`, and instead of `expand`, use `fullscreen`.
