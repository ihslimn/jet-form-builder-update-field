# HorizontalRule

A drop-in replacement for the HTML [hr](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/hr) element that works both on the web and in the mobile apps. It represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section.

## Usage

```jsx
import { HorizontalRule } from '@wordpress/components';

const MyHorizontalRule = () => <HorizontalRule />;
```
